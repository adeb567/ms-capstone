#'Assessment of the Utility of Image Enhancement For Underwater Tasks'

Advisor: Junaed Sattar

##Abstract

Recently, learning-based image enhancement methods have demonstrated promising performance in underwater conditions. However, these models often come with a high computational cost. In this study, we aim to evaluate the relevance of image enhancement based on the specific task at hand. Additionally, we strive to develop a predictive method to determine whether image enhancement is necessary. Enhanced images were generated using ’Fast Underwater Image Enhancement for Improved Visual Perception’ (FUnIE- GAN) [1] and were evaluated quantitatively and visually. Further, bounding boxes were predicted using object detection models for both original and enhanced images. These predictions were analyzed and binary labels were created for the images to predict the necessity of image enhancement for the task. Despite our efforts, we have encountered challenges in devising an effective predictive method due to the limitations of the training set. This idea does show promise for further exploration with a specialized dataset to train all the models involved.
